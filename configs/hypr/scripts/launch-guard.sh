# Launch wrapper for the pill launcher. Runs the app, keeps the first 64K of
# its stderr and, when it dies non-zero inside the first seconds, raises a
# critical toast with a Copy action that puts exit code plus full stderr on the
# clipboard. Later exits are the user closing the app and stay silent.
#
# stderr is drained for the whole app lifetime: a reader that quits after the
# cap would hand the app SIGPIPE on its next log line, a plain file would grow
# for hours under chatty apps. So this script lives as long as the app does.
#
# Usage: launch-guard.sh <name> <icon> <workdir> <cmd> [args...]
