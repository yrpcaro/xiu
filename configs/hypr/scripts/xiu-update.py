"""
Update engine for the xiu rice. The in-app Settings updater shells out to
this and parses the single JSON object it prints on stdout.

The model: keep a dedicated pristine clone that the user never touches, so a pull
is always clean. Code files (the QML shell, helper scripts, everything that isn't
hardware or taste config) get overwritten with upstream wholesale. The handful of
protected files that hold a user's machine and preferences (monitors, binds, env
and so on) get three-way merged against the version they were last reconciled to,
so a personal edit survives an upstream change as long as the two don't touch the
same lines. An overlapping change is reported as a conflict and the live file is
left exactly as the user had it.

A manifest records the upstream sha each protected file was last reconciled to and
the upstream sha of the last successful apply, which is also the base for the next
three-way merge and the start of the changelog range.

The maintainer and anyone who installed by symlinking the config into a git
work-tree are detected as devmode and left alone, since they update with plain git.
