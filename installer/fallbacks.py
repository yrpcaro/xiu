"""
Tier-3 fallback handlers for the Ricelin installer. These cover the packages
that have no native package on a given distro family, so the installer has to
fetch them another way: build from source, pull a prebuilt release, run a
crate install, or hand off to Flathub or a project's own installer.

Each handler returns an ordered list of steps and nothing runs here. A step is
either {"desc": ..., "run": [argv...]} for a plain command, or
{"desc": ..., "shell": "..."} when it needs a pipe or a redirect. The installer
decides when and how to execute them; this module only describes the work.
